```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### 3. Configure Network Settings
To set a fixed IP address for the system:

```bash
# Replace YourWiFiConnectionName with your connection name
# You can find it using: nmcli connection show
sudo nmcli connection modify "YourWiFiConnectionName" \
    ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.84/24 \
    ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 \
    ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4" \
    ipv4.method manual

# Apply the changes
sudo nmcli connection up "YourWiFiConnectionName"
```

### 4. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Environment Settings
```bash
cp dot-env.template .env
```
Edit the `.env` file to set your HTTP server, robot parameters, and voice service API keys.

### 6. Set Up Audio Assets
```bash
mkdir -p audio/assets/forest audio/assets/owls
# Add your audio files:
# - audio/assets/forest/ (ambient sounds in WAV format)
# - audio/assets/owls/ (owl sound effects in WAV format)
```

â””â”€â”€ utils/                      # Utility functions
```

## Configuration

1. Update `config/settings.py` with your specific hardware settings:
```python
# Example configuration
AUDIO_SETTINGS = {
    'sample_rate': 44100,
    'channels': 2,
    'buffer_size': 1024
}

ROBOT_SETTINGS = {
    'port': '/dev/ttyUSB0',
    'baud_rate': 115200
}
```

2. Adjust room dimensions and audio parameters in `audio/soundscape.py`:
```python
ROOM_DIMENSIONS = [5.0, 4.0, 3.0]  # Width, length, height in meters
SOURCE_RANGE = [0.5, 4.5]          # Min/max source positions
```

3. Configure voice preferences for elderly users in `.env`:
```
TTS_RATE=0.9             # Slightly slower speech rate
TTS_PITCH=1.0            # Normal pitch
TTS_VOLUME=0.8           # Moderate volume
```

## Soundscape Setup

The system uses WAV audio files (not MP3) stored in specific directories:

1. Create ambient sounds in `audio/assets/forest/`:
   - Nature sounds like birds, wind, rain, etc.
   - Recommended format: 44.1kHz, 16-bit WAV files
   - Keep files under 30 seconds for better memory usage

2. Add owl sounds in `audio/assets/owls/`:
   - Various owl calls and responses
   - Same technical specifications as above

The SpatialScaper library creates a 3D audio environment from these files, placing sounds at different virtual positions to create an immersive experience.

## User Profiles

HootScape Healthcare stores user profiles in `data/profiles/` as JSON files:

```bash
mkdir -p data/profiles
```

Each profile contains:
- Personal information
- Medication schedules
- Health metric history
- Emergency contacts
- Voice and interaction preferences

## Usage

1. Start the system:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. The system will:
   - Initialize the soundscape with forest ambience
   - Start the voice recognition system
   - Begin listening for "Hey Owl" wake word
   - Load user profiles if available

3. Healthcare Voice Commands:
   - "Hey Owl, remind me to take my medication"
   - "Hey Owl, check my blood pressure"
   - "Hey Owl, call my caregiver"
   - "Hey Owl, let's talk for a while"

## API Command Format

The system accepts commands via HTTP POST requests to `/owl/command` on port 9123. The endpoint supports several payload formats:

### 1. Speech Command

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "speech": {
    "text": "It's time to take your medication.",
    "rate": 0.9,
    "pitch": 1.0
  }
}' http://localhost:9123/owl/command
```

### 2. Movement Sequence

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "movements": [
    {"type": 5, "duration": 1},
    {"type": 6, "duration": 1},
    {"type": 5, "duration": 1}
  ]
}' http://localhost:9123/owl/command
```

### 3. Combined Healthcare Command

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "speech": {
    "text": "Don't forget to drink water with your medication.",
    "rate": 0.9,
    "pitch": 1.0
  },
  "movements": [
    {"type": 1, "duration": 1},
    {"type": 3, "duration": 1}
  ]
}' http://localhost:9123/owl/command
```

### 4. Macro Commands

Execute predefined movement sequences using named macros:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "macro": "happy"
}' http://localhost:9123/owl/command
```

## Elderly User Considerations

- **Voice Recognition**: Optimize for older voices that may be softer or less distinct
- **Speech Output**: Use slightly slower speech rate with clear enunciation
- **Visual Feedback**: Ensure owl movements are gentle and non-startling
- **Command Simplicity**: Keep voice commands simple and natural
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent interaction patterns
